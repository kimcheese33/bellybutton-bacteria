# Bellybutton Biodiversity

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to analyze bacteria in bellybuttons to determine how this bacteria can be used to create artifical meat. The dataset contained demographic info about each test subject, as well as the bacteria that was gathered from his/her bellybutton. To show the results, I utilized JavaScript, Plotly, and D3 to build a report with various charts that dynamically update based on dropdown menu selection.
